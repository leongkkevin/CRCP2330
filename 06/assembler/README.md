# Nand-2-Tetris Assembler

This is a program that creates a .hack file of binary based on a .asm input
of assembly language.

## Building and Running the Program

To build this program first navigate to the project directory. For example:

```console
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/CRCP2330/06/assembler
```

Then make a new directory called build:

```console
mkdir build
```

Then navigate into the new build directory and run the following commands:

```console
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then, to run the program:

```console
./Assembler <Path to file>
```
Personally, I used a C++ IDE (Jetbrains CLion) to run my program. If you have any
questions on building and running this program, please do not hesitate to reach out.
